To begin working on the tickets you need to log back into OsTicket go to the Admin Panel > Tickets > Open. Make sure you have given yourself the permissions needed to completely work the tickets. Then you will see all the open tickets that need to be worked on.

<p>
To make sure that SLA is met, go through all tickets and set the level of priority for each one. You can chose from Sev-A (Emergency), Sev-B (High), Sev-C (Normal).

To ensure each ticket gets worked by the right professionals, you can assign the tickets to a department or agent in particular. You can let the user know that you have assigned their ticket to a particular agent so that they stay informed.

After resolving the issue, post a reply to inform the user and then go to ticket status at the bottom to click resovled. You can also chose close for ticket status, but in this case you will not be able to open it up again.
